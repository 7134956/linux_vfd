config VFD_ENABLE
	tristate "7-segment LED display support"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use the driver for 7-segment
	  LED displays connected to a LED display driver IC like
	  SM1628, FD628 etc.

	  Communication with the driver IC is done via bit-banging
	  several GPIOs.

	  This driver also optionaly provides input via buttons
	  connected to same IC.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called vfd.

config VFD_NO_KEY_INPUT
	tristate "No key input from IC"
	default n
	depends on VFD_ENABLE
	help
	  Select this option if you don't have any buttons
	  connected to the driver IC. The driver will not
	  create any input device in this case.
