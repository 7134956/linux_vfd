vfdd, the vfd companion daemon
------------------------------

vfdd is the demon that drives the LCD display managed by the vfd linux driver.
It is very simple, small and fast, but at the same time it is pretty flexible
and easily extendable. It is meant to eat as little resources as possible.
It can run from plain Linux or from Android.

The config file is well commented and self-explanatory.


Building for Linux
------------------

Well, just run 'make'. You can define the CROSS_COMPILE variable to create
binaries for other platforms, for example:

	make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- LDFLAGS=-static MODE=release


Building for Android
--------------------

vfdd builds as a Native Android binary. All you have to do is to download NDK,
then run $(NDK_ROOT)/ndk-build. You will end with an arm-v7 and an aarch64
executable in the libs/ subdirectory.

Also take care that BioniC (the glibc replacement in Android) has a lame
getopt() implementation, so config file name must come last on the command
line, e.g:

	vfdd vfd-debug.ini -v                 -- WRONG
	vfdd -v vfd-debug.ini                 -- RIGHT
